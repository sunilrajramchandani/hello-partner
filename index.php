		<blockquote>
			<p class = "well">I am Ivann Archie Arintok, 
			a student of College of Saint Benilde currently taking up BS-Information Systems. 
			I am 20 years old. I grew up in the province of Batangas and just moved to Manila for education and work purposes. 
			There are times when I miss the province because of its simplicity and closeness to nature. 
			Back then, I wrote for DLSUâ€™s official Filipino school publication, Ang Pahayagang Plaridel. 
			Coming from a business course, my transfer to a computer related one has made me more comfortable knowing that this is where my heart is. 
			I am interested in technology and I like reading articles about it. 
			I feel excited whenever a new technological innovation comes out and I look forward to its implementation here in the Philippines.
			I love tinkering and customizing software to extend its capabilities. 
			I chose Information Systems as my course because it goes in line with my interests. 
			Furthermore, I like to gain technical knowledge and programming skills so I can one day become a successful IT professional. 
			I also frequently watch movies on my spare time and I am a great fan of Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio. 
			I also watch TV series such as DareDevil and Silicon Valley. I also read books, fiction and non-fiction alike. 
			Often, I find books are a great way to learn new things and at the same time, gain a temporary deviation from reality. 
			The type of music I generally listen to is alternative rock and indie folk; a type of music that combines Western country music with the sounds of contemporary folk music.  
			I am fond of playing team sports because it challenges me whenever I play with other people. Among the team sports, 
			I prefer playing basketball the most and despite the hate directed towards him, Lebron James is my favorite player.</p>
