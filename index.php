		<blockquote>
		<p>I am Ivann Archie Arintok, 
		a student of College of Saint Benilde currently taking up BS-Information Systems. 
		I am 20 years old. I grew up in the province of Batangas and just moved to Manila for education and work purposes. 
		There are times when I miss the province because of its simplicity and closeness to nature. 
		Back then, I wrote for DLSUâ€™s official Filipino school publication, Ang Pahayagang Plaridel. 
		Coming from a business course, my transfer to a computer related one has made me more comfortable knowing that this is where my heart is. 
		I am interested in technology and I like reading articles about it. 
		I feel excited whenever a new technological innovation comes out and I look forward to its implementation here in the Philippines.
		I love tinkering and customizing software to extend its capabilities. 
		I chose Information Systems as my course because it goes in line with my interests. 
		Furthermore, I like to gain technical knowledge and programming skills so I can one day become a successful IT professional. 
		I also frequently watch movies on my spare time and I am a great fan of Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio. 
		I also watch TV series such as DareDevil and Silicon Valley. I also read books, fiction and non-fiction alike. 
		Often, I find books are a great way to learn new things and at the same time, gain a temporary deviation from reality. 
		The type of music I generally listen to is alternative rock and indie folk; a type of music that combines Western country music with the sounds of contemporary folk music.  
		I am fond of playing team sports because it challenges me whenever I play with other people. Among the team sports, 
		I prefer playing basketball the most and despite the hate directed towards him, Lebron James is my favorite player.</p>
